SUMMARY
-------
This package contains a collection of filtered, high precision triples within a target vocabulary. The tuples constitute simple facts about the world along with a rough degree of quantification (most/some). For example:

QStrength	Quantifier	Arg1	Pred	Arg2	Sentence	Score	Inferred?	Multiword?	Canonical?	Domain	Range	Provenance
0.92	most	aardvark	eat	insect	Most aardvarks eat insects.	0.77	n	n	n	animal_n1	insect_n1	830913 
0.83	most	grass seed	need	consistent moisture	Most grass seeds need consistent moisture.	0.79	y	y	n	plant_part_n1	state_n4	248630 
0.92	most	house	have	wall	Most houses have walls.	0.84	y	n	n	building_n1	artifact_n1	799741 816067 
0.25	some	panda	live in	zoo	Some pandas live in zoos.	0.75	y	n	n	animal_n1	artifact_n1	484726 
0.50	some	acid	kill	bacterium	Some acid kills bacteria.	1.00	n	n	n	substance_n1	microorganism_n1	880809 608079 670305 
0.50	some	acid	destroy	bacterium	Some acid destroys bacteria.	0.93	y	n	m	substance_n1	microorganism_n1	816424  (acid, kill, bacterium)
0.83	most	house	provide	shade	Most houses provide shades.	0.81	y	n	y	building_n1	state_n4	(house, offer, shade)
0.92	most	aardvark	consume	insect	Most aardvarks consume insects.	0.77	y	n	y	animal_n1	insect_n1	(aardvark, eat, insect)

PACKAGE CONTENTS
----------------

README.txt	  - This file
COMBINED-KB.tsv	  - 282594 (Arg1 Relation Arg2) triples related to high school general knowledge and science (see below).
		    This file is a combination of several tuple sources contained in the kb-components folder EXCEPT for 
		    the (more noisy) science-inferred.tsv set, and the animal-negatives.tsv.
		    Note that subsequent to the TACL paper, quantifiers were added to the tuples using a simple Turk task.
relations.txt	  - list of the 1605 Relations used in the tensor
entities.txt	  - list of the 6465 headwords used in the Arg1/Arg2 positions, and their type
types.tsv	  - we selected 49 types (with help from WordNet) to mark the domain/range of triples (see below), plus "Thing" for the remainder.
type-taxonomy.tsv - taxonomic relations between the selected types.
Domain Vocabulary - mar2016.tsv   - the domain vocabulary used to restrict tuple words

TACL
----------
TACL-paper.pdf	- Description of how the science KB (TACL/TACL-kb.tsv, below) was created.
		 (Dalvi, B., Tandon, N., Clark, P. "Domain-Targeted, High Precision Knowledge Extraction", TACL, 2017 (to appear))
TACL-kb.tsv	- The original KB described in the TACL paper. This has since been slightly expanded and further cleaned to 
		  be kb-components/science.tsv, the main component of COMBINED-KB.tsv.
reference-kb.tsv - These are the reference triples, sampled from the Aristo Mini Corpus (http://www.allenai.org/data.html) and 
		   scored by Turkers as "true", used to assess coverage of TACL/TACL-kb.tsv (reported in the TACL paper).

----------------------
KB-COMPONENTS
----------------------
The components of the KB are in the kb-components directory. 
The COMBINED-KB.tsv is the deduplicated union of these KBs EXCEPT for science-inferred.tsv and animal-negatives.tsv. 
   When deduplicating tuples, the entry with the highest qstrength is retained and the provenances concatenated.

animals.tsv		- 19629 tuples where Arg1 or Arg2 is an animal (see types.tsv for list of animals)
animal-negatives.tsv	- 47204 NEGATIVE examples of tuples about animals. Not included in COMBINED-KB.tsv, but may be useful for
			  	KB completion research.
science.tsv		- 217076 tuples about science (The headword of Arg1 or Arg2 is a concrete noun, see entities.tsv)	
science-inferred.tsv	- 76924 additional tuples about science, inferred solely from schema mapping rules. These are a little
			  	noiser than the original tuples, and so not included in COMBINED-KB.tsv by default.
parts.tsv		- 31795 parts relations, derived from WordNet3.0. All are assumed to be nearly universal over Arg1 (quantifier = "most", qstrength = 1.00)
partof.tsv		- 7440 partof relations, derived from WordNet3.0. The quantifier strength of (x is-part-of y) = 1/n(x is-part-of *)
isa.tsv			- 8250 isa relations, derived from WordNet3.0. All are assumed to be nearly universal over Arg1 (quantifier = "most", qstrength = 1.00)

-----------------------
COLUMNS IN THE KB FILES
-----------------------

In aristo-tuples-jan2017.tsv, the columns are:
   QStrength	- The quantification strength of the triple (0-1), where 1 = applies to most members of Arg1, 0 = applies to just a few members of Arg1.
		  The scale is purely a ranking scale (has no probabilistic meaning) - feel free to rescale it as required for your application.
   Quantifier	- Simple qualitative quantifier: if QStrength > 0.5 it is "most", otherwise it is "some".		  			  
   Arg1		- in (Arg1 Pred Arg2) 
   Pred		- in (Arg1 Pred Arg2)
   Arg2		- in (Arg1 Pred Arg2)
   Sentence	- Expression of this tuple as an English sentence.
   Score	- This score is now redundant (superceded by QStrength), but was the either Turk-derived or model-derived quality of the tuple (range 0-1)
   Inferred?	- "n": The tuple was directly extracted from text, WordNet, or produced by KBCompletion. The source sentence(s) id(s) are listed in the Provenance field.
   		  "y": The tuple was inferred using schema mapping rule(s) from other tuple(s). The source tuple(s) are listed in the Provenance field.
		  "m": Mixed - the tuple was both extracted from text and inferred. The source sentences and tuples are listed in the Provenance field.
   Multiword?	- If the Arg1 or Arg2 include a multiword, this is "y", else "n"
   Canonical?	- The tuple is in its canonical (normalized) form. (We retain both the original and canonical forms in this database). 
   		  Non-canonical tuples are also transformed to a canonical form, elsewhere in the database.
   Domain	- The general type of Arg1
   Range	- The general type of Arg2
   Provenance	- KBCompletion - inferred by KB Completion methods.
		  WordNet3.0 - tuple comes from WordNet v3.0.
		  (cat, eat, food) - tuple was inferred from this tuple using a schema mapping rule (see TACL paper)
		  12413 - tuple was extracted from sentence with ID 12413. Source setnences are available on request.
		  a1344 - tuple was extracted from sentence with ID a1344 (IDs can have an alphabetic prefix). Source setnences are available on request.

0.50	some	acid	destroy	bacterium	Some acid destroys bacteria.	0.93	y	n	m	substance_n1	microorganism_n1	816424  (acid, kill, bacterium)
0.83	most	house	provide	shade	Most houses provide shades.	0.81	y	n	y	building_n1	state_n4	(house, offer, shade)

 * (aardvark, eat, insect) was extracted from sentence 830913, and was rated as applying to most aardvarks (quantifier 0.92).
 * (aardvark, consume, insect) is the canonical form for (aardvark, eat, insect), inferred from an induced schema rule (animal_n1,eat,insect_n1) -> (animal_n1,consume,insect_n1) 
 * (grass seed, need, consistent moisture) is a multiword tuple
 * (panda, live in, zoo) only applies to some (quantifier 0.25) pandas.
 * (acid, destroy, bacterium) was both extracted (from sentence 816424) and inferred (from a rule applied to (acid, kill, bacterium)).
